# Gene Loader
Load genes, transcripts and diseases directly into LOVD3, using reliable external sources (HGNC and OMIM).

### OMIM Data
In order to import diseases into LOVD, you will need to [obtain approval](http://www.omim.org/downloads)
 from OMIM to get access to the OMIM disease data stored in the morbidmap.txt file.
Once you have been granted access, download the morbidmap.txt file and
 place it in the same directory as the geneloader.php script.
Importing the OMIM disease data is optional.
